Through this initiative, we introduce youngsters from Amazonian rural communities where there are Vaga Lume libraries to youngsters in the city of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The idea is to create opportunities for them to get to know each other, talk and exchange experiences about themselves and their relationships with the environment they live in.

Over the course of a year the groups of students meet each other through exchanged assignments and have the opportunity of meeting face to face in a camp at the end of the cycle!

That way, we bring realities closer and help these youngsters to recognize each other in their similarities and respect each other’s singularities. In this program, they also have the opportunity to reflect upon their place in society and understand the relationships and connection between us all.
