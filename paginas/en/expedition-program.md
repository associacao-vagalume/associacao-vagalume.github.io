Through this program, we encourage the access to reading in Amazonian rural communities. We do so by donating books, shelves and mats for the communities to build their own libraries, and training mothers, fathers, educators – whoever is interested – as reading mediators, getting the books off the shelves and making them reach children, youngsters and adults.

We also stimulate community management; after all, these libraries belong to the communities! And for all that to make even more sense to the communities, we promote the local culture by encouraging and training the communities to write handcrafted books with their own stories.

As such, we work to build readers, because we believe that reading opens new doors and offers many opportunities for children and youngsters of the Amazon.
